# twitter_shiny
This repository includes a shiny app that creates visualizations for twitter data. 
The data includes 100,000 tweets from various places across the U.S.
The visualizations include interactive wordclouds, a plot of tweet distribution across time, and an overall distribution of tweet sentiment. 
This shiny App was a contribution to a larger project that can be found at [link posted soon].
